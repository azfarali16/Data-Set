Hi there,=0D
We wanted to let you know that your request (#11333161) has been updated.=

Hi Syed,=0D
=0D
Nyla here this time and I thank you for the update.=0D
=0D
I understand you'd like to know if your Gig's score is going to be affect=
ed by other sellers especially if you don't receive work for some time.=0D=

=0D
Generally, your success score is affected by other sellers who offer the =
same services as you and within the same price range. This should mean th=
at your score can increase or decrease depending on whether you're going =
better or worse than they do. Additionally, if you don't receive orders f=
or some time, this can affect your score, but there most likely won't be =
a sudden drop in the metrics, and you'll have time to improve it.=0D
=0D
I advise focusing on improving your metrics, which you can always see on =
your Gigs, and keep in mind that this takes time, as it's about your serv=
ices in general, not just one specific order that suddenly affected you.=0D=

=0D
I hope the above information is useful to you. If you have any other ques=
tions, please let me know.=0D

Kind regards,=0D

=0D
Hi there=0D
=0D
Thank you for your answer. However, I have some queries that need to be a=
nswered.=0D
=0D
Your statement, "Success score is relative to other sellers on the market=
place," suggests that my gig can receive a negative factor on Client Sati=
sfaction any day. This is something that should only reflect the reviews =
I receive from the clients I have worked with. If it's relative to other =
sellers, how can I be sure if I am doing the right thing? The new system =
was supposed to be more transparent than the previous one, so why am I st=
ill left in the dark?=0D
=0D
What I am trying to understand is, even if I have not received any work f=
or some time, can my gig be negatively impacted because another seller di=
d?=0D
=0D

Igor, Mar 30, 2024, 6:40=E2=80=AFAM GMT+3=0D
=0D
Hi Azfar,=0D
Igor here. I am sorry for the late response. We are experiencing higher v=
olumes than usual and trying to respond to inquiries as soon as possible.=
 I appreciate your concerns regarding your success score as it is vital t=
o your growth on the platform. I=E2=80=99ll gladly guide you on what to d=
o next.=0D
=0D
I took a look at your account and see that The key areas that require you=
r attention for gig "I will design your album cover art or music artwork"=
 are Client satisfaction and Conflict-free orders.** **=0D
=0D
Client satisfaction is measured by looking at different information from =
reviews you received. This includes public ratings and anonymous ones. So=
metimes, the private ratings are very different from the public ones. Thi=
s means that clients may have concerns or issues that haven't been fully =
addressed, despite what you may have initially thought about their satisf=
action.=0D
=0D
The conflict-free orders key area indicates the frequency and nature of r=
eported disputes and issues during the order process.=0D
=0D
Clear communication and an organized work process make everything easier.=
 You can do this by being clear about what your services include in your =
gig description, FAQ, and packages, and by creating a quick response that=
 explains your process and any policies that are important to make the bu=
yer aware of. This is especially important when sending a custom offer.=0D=

=0D
It=E2=80=99s also good to keep in mind that the success score is relative=
 to other sellers on the marketplace within your gig category and price b=
enchmark. Gig's performance is constantly compared to others in the marke=
tplace. Therefore, you may see fluctuations in your score even without de=
livering new orders.=0D
=0D
Here's an article that provides an in-depth explanation for each key area=
 of the success score: Success Score, Explained, Explained. You can also =
visit the Forum post regarding the new level system questions and feedbac=
k to read more.=0D

Hello,=0D

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding the topic =
I discussed above 24 hours ago. Typically, responses take around 14 hours=
, but I haven't received a reply yet. I understand you may be experiencin=
g a high volume of inquiries, but I would appreciate it if you could prio=

Hi,=0D
=0D
I hope you are doing well. I wanted to inquire about the success score on=
 my gig "Design your Album Cover or Music Artwork". I delivered my last o=
rder 20 days ago, and at that time, my success score was 5. However, sudd=
enly, I received a message informing me that my success score has decreas=
ed to 4. =0D
=0D
What confuses me is that my success score changed without any apparent re=
ason. It has been 20 days since I was last reviewed by a client, so I do =
not understand what could have caused the change in my success score.=0D
=0D
I would appreciate it if you could provide some clarification on why my s=
uccess score has decreased. Thank you for your attention to this matter.=0D=

=0D
Best regards, Azfar=0D

te response. We are experiencing higher volumes than usual and trying to =
respond to inquiries as soon as possible. I appreciate your concerns rega=
rding your success score as it is vital to your growth on the platform. I=
=E2=80=99ll gladly guide you on what to do next.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I too=
k a look at your account and see that<strong> </strong>The key areas that=
 require your attention for gig "I will design your album cover art or mu=
sic artwork" are Client satisfaction and Conflict-free orders.<strong>&nb=
sp;</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Client satisfaction is measured by looking at d=
ifferent information from reviews you received. This includes public rati=
ngs and anonymous ones. Sometimes, the private ratings are very different=
 from the public ones. This means that clients may have concerns or issue=
s that haven't been fully addressed, despite what you may have initially =
thought about their satisfaction.<br>&nbsp;<br>The conflict-free orders k=
ey area indicates the frequency and nature of reported disputes and issue=
s during the order process.<br>&nbsp;<br>Clear communication and an organ=
ized work process make everything easier.&nbsp;You can do this by&nbsp;be=
ing clear about what your services include in your gig description, FAQ, =
and packages, and by creating a quick response that explains your process=
 and any policies that are important to make the buyer aware of. This is =
especially important when sending a custom offer.<br>&nbsp;<br>It=E2=80=99=
s also good to keep in mind that the success score is relative to other s=
ellers on the marketplace within your gig category and price benchmark. G=
ig's performance is constantly compared to others in the marketplace. The=
refore, you may see fluctuations in your score even without delivering ne=
w orders.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here's an article that provides an in-depth explan=
ation for each key area of the success score:&nbsp;<a rel=3D"noopener nor=
